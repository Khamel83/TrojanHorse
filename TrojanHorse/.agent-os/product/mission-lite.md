# Product Mission (Lite)

TrojanHorse is a local-first, privacy-focused audio capture and transcription system that helps professionals in remote work environments solve the problem of lost context by continuously capturing, transcribing, and organizing work-related conversations and audio into a searchable knowledge base.

TrojanHorse serves remote workers and knowledge workers who need to capture and recall information from conversations. Unlike cloud-based transcription services, TrojanHorse processes all data locally, ensuring that sensitive conversations remain private and secure.
